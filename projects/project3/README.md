### Caliber Staging Module with CSS, React, Redux, JSX, Flask-RestPlus, Python,
### MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS
The Caliber Staging Module allows Staging Managers to more effectively manage
the associates under their supervision. The system automatically assigns a
cohort to Staging Managers as they enter Staging. Staging Managers can perform a
SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunity, Threats) analysis of individual
associates and view data about the associate from their time in training
imported from Caliber.
